## A prometheus client library written in PHP

This is a fork of ['jimdo/prometheus_client_php'](https://github.com/Jimdo/prometheus_client_php).

In the original lib isn't possible to select the database namespace on Redis.
Extends the adapter or inject an Redis instance with this type of configuration is not possible too.
So, we create this fork just for enable this feature.

# How this lib works?

You can read about in this ['link'](https://github.com/Jimdo/prometheus_client_php) on our wiki, is the original implementation, 
but we add the new feature.
